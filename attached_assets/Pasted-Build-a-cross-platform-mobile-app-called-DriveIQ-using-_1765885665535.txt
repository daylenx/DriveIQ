Build a cross-platform mobile app called DriveIQ using React Native + Expo + TypeScript and Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage).

Features

Auth

Email/password sign up + login (Firebase Auth)

Vehicles

Users can add multiple vehicles with: year, make, model, optional trim/nickname, optional VIN, required starting odometer

Store vehicles in Firestore under the user

Maintenance engine

Preload a default maintenance library from a local JSON file (oil, tire rotation, brakes, tires, transmission fluid, filters, coolant, spark plugs, belts, battery, alignment, etc.)

Each item uses “miles OR months, whichever comes first”

For each vehicle, create a per-vehicle task list copied from defaults (so the user can edit intervals per vehicle)

Dashboard shows Due Soon / Overdue / Next Up with miles remaining + estimated due date

Service logging

User can mark a maintenance item as done and create a log with: date, odometer, notes, cost, and optional receipt photo upload to Firebase Storage

When a log is created, automatically recompute next due mileage/date for that task

Trips + mileage (MVP)

Implement trip tracking using phone GPS speed thresholds:

Start trip when speed > 7 mph for 30 seconds

Record points every 10–25 meters, ignore points where accuracy > 50m

End trip when speed < 2 mph for 180 seconds

Compute trip distance by summing distance between points

Save trips to Firestore and add trip miles to the active vehicle’s odometer

Multi-vehicle: include an “Active Vehicle” selector; after trip ends show “Logged to [vehicle]. Change? Not my car?” If “Not my car”, trip is unassigned and does not affect odometer.

VIN + Recall (optional)

If user enters VIN, decode and fetch recalls using NHTSA APIs; show them in a Safety screen.

UI

Bottom tabs: Dashboard, Vehicles, Trips, Logs, Settings (+ Safety if recalls)

Clean minimal UI

Deliverables

Provide full repo structure, Firestore schema, security rules, TypeScript types, and runnable Expo app with setup instructions.

Keep trip tracking as “foreground tracking” initially (works while app is open). Add TODO notes for background/always-on tracking for later.
