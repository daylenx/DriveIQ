1) Gentle odometer update reminder (non-annoying)

Add a soft reminder system that encourages users to keep their odometer up to date without feeling pushy.

Behavior:

Track the date of the last odometer update for each vehicle.

If a vehicle’s odometer hasn’t been updated in 14 days, show a small, non-blocking banner on that vehicle’s dashboard.

The tone should be helpful and calm, not urgent or alarming.

Example copy:
“Quick check-in: update your odometer to keep reminders accurate.”

Include a clear call-to-action such as “Update now.”

Allow users to snooze the reminder for 7, 14, or 30 days.

Do not show the reminder more than once per week.

Allow users to disable odometer reminders entirely from settings.

This reminder should never block app usage and should never be framed as an error.

2) Maintenance cost summary (premium feature)

Add a maintenance cost summary feature that builds on existing service logs.

Behavior:

Maintenance logs may include an optional cost field.

Add a “Cost Summary” section per vehicle that shows:

Total amount spent on maintenance

Optional breakdown by category (engine, tires, brakes, etc.)

A short list of recent maintenance costs

Treat this as a Pro feature:

Free users can see a locked preview explaining the benefit.

Example copy:
“See how much you’ve spent on maintenance with DriveIQ Pro.”

Core maintenance logging should remain available to all users.

Include a developer-only way to simulate Pro access for testing.

The goal is to highlight long-term value and insights without blocking core functionality.

3) Fleet wording polish (important UX fix)

Update wording related to adding people to a fleet account to sound professional and business-appropriate.

Change:

Replace all instances of “Invite family member” with clearer, more neutral language.

New wording:

Use “Invite member” as the default.

Optionally use “Invite team member” on fleet-specific screens.

Rules:

Personal accounts should not show invite options.

Fleet accounts should consistently use professional wording across buttons, headers, modals, and empty states.

This is a wording and UI polish change only; underlying logic remains the same.
